"""The GNL ladder achievements, as wc3.no computes them.

The 24 rules and their conditions were read out of the wc3.no production
bundle (`assets/index-CKpjbYLg.js`), set `gnl_season_16`: the definitions
object holds id, points, icon, name and description, and one `calculate`
function holds every condition. This module is that function in Python, so
the totals here equal the totals wc3.no publishes.

A rule reads the same rows the ladder totals read: the player's matches on
his league race, longer than core.ladder.MIN_DURATION_S, inside the window,
oldest first. Four rules read more than that and take it as arguments: the
player's ladder points, the tags of the players on the other teams, the tags
of the season's coaches, and whether the player coaches himself.

Three rules pay a variable amount, exactly as the bundle does: duck_hunting
adds 5 per kill and the race rule adds 1 per win, both on top of the base,
and only the single race the player beat most often ever pays.

Two rules read a day. The bundle buckets by the UTC day a match ended on and
this module by the day it started on, because the table keeps a start time.
The race rule reads the opponent's race after a random pick is resolved,
where the bundle reads Random.

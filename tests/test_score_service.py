"""The scoring math, called directly on the service.

No web framework and no database: the score system comes from a stub
settings service, and getScoreByMapScore touches nothing else.

The GNL scale: losing scores keep their map score (0 or 1); a winning
2-x score converts to points from the top of the scale, and the scale
depends on the score system (standard tops at 3, helpstone at 4).

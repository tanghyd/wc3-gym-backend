"""One active KOTH signup per twitch name and race

Two chat messages in the same second made two signups, because nothing in
the database stopped the second one. A generated column holds the twitch
name while the signup is active and NULL after it, so the unique index
counts only the active signups and a retired signup blocks nothing.

Signups that repeat a key lose their active flag before the index is
built. The lowest id of each key keeps it, so the first signup wins. The
downgrade drops the index and the column; it does not give the flag back.

"""Make the w3c stats unique per user, race and season

The sync reads the rows of a player and then writes them, so two syncs of
one player could both find no row and both insert one. The unique index
stops the duplicate. The delete first removes the duplicates the database
already holds, and keeps the highest id of each key because that row is
the one the last sync wrote. The delete cannot roll back, so take a dump
of the database before this revision runs.

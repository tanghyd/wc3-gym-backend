"""One fantasy bet per bettor and series

Prod holds two identical bets by brittonvol on series 411 (ids 761 and 824),
so the old app counted that bet twice. Nothing but a unique index stops a
second bet: both importers write per row, and a bettor who changes their
pick would otherwise leave two rows that both score. The delete keeps the
lowest id of each key, the bet that was made first. The delete cannot roll
back, so take a dump of the database before this revision runs.
